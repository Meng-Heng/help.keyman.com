# HOWTO: Type iota subscript with a non-QWERTY US keyboard 

## Issue
You may be having trouble finding an iota subscript on the Keyman keyboards **Greek Classical** and **Galaxie BibleScript Greek**  when you are using a 102-key keyboard like:
- UK QWERTY
- AZERTY
- QWERTZ

## Solution
To solve this issue, you should associate your Keyman keyboard to your hardware layout. Follow the instructions below to associate **except** where the instructions mention the layout **US**, use your hardware keyboard standard instead:
[Associating Keyman Keyboard Layouts for Best Performance](./kb0063.md)

Then to get iota subscript: 
  - on UK QWERTY, type <kbd>~</kbd>
  - on AZERTY, type <kbd>Âµ</kbd>
  - on QWERTZ, type <kbd>'</kbd>
  - on another 102-key keyboard, ask us on our [community site](https://community.software.sil.org/c/keyman/19) for more details.

## Background
The reason you are experiencing this issue is that the Classical Greek keyboard you are using was initially designed for the hardware keyboard standard US QWERTY.
