# INFO: Why is the "select keyboard layout for all applications" checkbox in Keyman Configuration disabled in Windows 8 and later versions?


The "select keyboard layout for all applications" checkbox is disabled on Windows 8, 8.1 and later versions, because these versions of Windows have this functionality built in.

The setting can be changed in Windows, with the following steps:
1. Open Control Panel
2. Select Language, Advanced Settings
3. Check the "Let me set a different input method for each app window" checkbox.
