# HOWTO: Migrate from KMFL to Keyman for Linux

KMFL hasn't been maintained for many years so we recommend users perform the following steps to migrate .kmn files to .kmp files and use Keyman for Linux.

With a little more work this can be entirely done on Linux with Keyman 17+:

## Prerequisites

- You'll need node.js, version 18.0 or later. On Ubuntu 24.04 this can be installed with:

  ```bash
  sudo apt install npm
  ```

  For older Ubuntu versions consult the [nodejs.org website](https://nodejs.org).

- Then install the Keyman keyboard compiler:

  ```bash
  sudo npm install -g @keymanapp/kmc
  ```

- You'll also need [install Keyman for Linux](https://help.keyman.com/products/linux/current-version/common/) for installing the .kmp keyboard package later:


## Convert the .kmn source file into a .kmp keyboard package

(replace `mykeyboard` with the name of your .kmn file)
- Create a file `mykeyboard.kpj`:

  ```xml
  <KeymanDeveloperProject>
    <Options>
      <Version>2.0</Version>
    </Options>
  </KeymanDeveloperProject>
  ```

- Create a file `source/mykeyboard.kps`:

  ```xml
  <Package>
    <Info>
      <Name>MyKeyboard</Name>
    </Info>
    <Files>
      <File>
        <Name>../build/mykeyboard.kmx</Name>
      </File>
    </Files>
    <Keyboards>
      <Keyboard>
        <Name>MyKeyboard</Name>
        <ID>mykeyboard</ID>
      </Keyboard>
    </Keyboards>
  </Package>
  ```

- Move your .kmn file to `source/mykeyboard.kmn`.

- Build with:

  ```bash
  kmc build mykeyboard.kpj
  ```

Disregard the error: `"TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'description')"`, as the compiler will already have created the .kmp file in the `build`
subdirectory. 

To properly do this without an error, you'll have to add some additional fields to the .kps file. It's easiest to let the `kmconvert` tool generate a template which will contain all necessary the fields:

```bash
kmconvert template -id mykeyboard
```

Unfortunately this tools isn't available for Linux yet. You should be able to use it in wine though.

## Use Keyman for Linux to install the .kmp keyboard package 

You can install the .kmp file with:

```bash
km-package-install -f build/mykeyboard.kmp
```

or with the Keyman Configuration tool.
