# HOWTO: Download a single keyboard folder from the Keyboards repository

The Keyman keyboards repository is very large, and downloading the entire
repository may be time consuming and on unstable Internet connections, difficult
to achieve.

See [Keyman Cloud Keyboard Repository](/developer/keyboards/) for details on how
to work with the Keyboards repository.

This KB article lists one possible way to download just a single keyboard folder. First, locate the keyboard folder you wish to download from [Keyman's Keyboard Repository](https://github.com/keymanapp/keyboards/tree/master). 

In this article, we'll be downloading the SIL IPA keyboard at [Keyman's SIL IPA Keyboard folder](https://github.com/keymanapp/keyboards/tree/master/release/sil/sil_ipa).

## Use a web site to download a zip file
The website https://download-directory.github.io/ allows you to download a
single folder from GitHub.
- Simply paste the keyboard folder into the form.  
e.g. keyboard folder: 
https://github.com/keymanapp/keyboards/tree/master/release/sil/sil_ipa
- Press Enter.

This will download a ZIP file containing the folder which you can extract onto
your computer.

Note that you may want to change the default name of the ZIP file ("keymanapp keyboards master release-sil_sil_ipa.zip" in this example)
to something else ("sil_ipa.zip" for example) when downloading the file.

Note also that attempting to download a large keyboard (or group of keyboards) may fail due to the large size.
