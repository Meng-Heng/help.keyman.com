# Keyman for iPhone and iPad, Keyman for Android: FAQ


## Question #1:
How can I add my own keyboard/font to the Keyman application?

## Answer:
Please read the articles: [Installing Custom Keyboards to your Android Device](https://help.keyman.com/developer/current-version/guides/distribute/install-kmp-android) 
and [Installing Custom Keyboards to your iPhone or iPad](https://help.keyman.com/developer/current-version/guides/distribute/install-kmp-ios). 
You can also send us the keyboard and we can add it to our repository.

## Question #2:
Why do some keyboards not display all the characters correctly?

## Answer:
Some keyboards require special fonts to display correctly. Some of these fonts are either currently unavailable in the app, or there is a font rendering issue.
