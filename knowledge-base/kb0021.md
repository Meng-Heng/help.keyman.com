# Characters appearing smaller than the selected font size

### **NOTE**: This archived documentation has not been updated recently and may contain information that is no longer relevant

If you are typing with a font that does not include all character glyphs, some characters may appear at a smaller size than the selected font size.

This is due to Windows font-linking -- it automatically selects a different font for those characters when the current font does not contain glyphs for them.

To correct this problem, select a font which includes glyphs for all the characters you are using.

EXAMPLE: In Notepad, using the SIL IPA Unicode keyboard, type 'hat_'. With the standard Notepad font selected (Lucida Console) the 't_' appears at a smaller size to the 'ha'.
