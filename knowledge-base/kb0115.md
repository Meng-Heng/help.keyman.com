# HOWTO: Migrate Keyboard OSK to use special OSK Font Instead of Dotted Circle (U+25CC)

Some OSK's use a dotted circle (U+25CC) as the base for displaying a combining diacritic mark. This can lead to  inconsistent behavior when displayed across Operating Systems (double dotted circles, blank keys, etc). A prefered method is to update the keyboard to use a special OSK font for better display:

* xyz.kmn

    * Update version number;
    * add `store(&DISPLAYMAP) '../../..shared/fonts/kbd/kbdxxxx/KbdXxxx.json'` (this file will be compiled into the .kmx so doesn't need including in the .kps)

* xyz.kvks

    * set to use KbdXxxx font (in "encoding" "fontname" element).
    * remove any U+25cc codes that were originally added to improve legibility

* xyz.kps

    * add ../../../shared/fonts/kbd/kbdxxxx/KbdXxxx.ttf to list of fonts
    * set **Keyboard font** to use the KbdXxxx font (used for OSK)

* Needed only for the first keyboard using the Xxxx script: in release/shared/fonts/kbd/kbdxxxx/ folder, add KbdXxxx.json and KbdXxxx.ttf
