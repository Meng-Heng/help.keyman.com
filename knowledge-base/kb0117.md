# HOWTO: Install a Keyman keyboard without a language on Keyman for Windows

This is a more in-depth guide to help install a Keyman keyboard onto Keyman for Windows without any language association using the Command Prompt, related to [transient LCIDs on Windows](/kb/116).

### Install khmer_angkor.kmp

* Download the `.kmp` file for [Khmer Angkor keyboard](https://keyman.com/keyboards/khmer_angkor) (or other keyboard of your choice) from [keyman.com](https://keyman.com/keyboards/).

* The file should be available at the *Package Download* of the keyboard details page

* By default, the file should be in the download folder: `Users\%userprofile%\Downloads`. But, can be specified to be in any other folder.

* Then, run the Command Prompt as Administrator.

### Install a Keyman keyboard without a language

* Once the Command Prompt is open, the path: `C:\Windows\system32>` might be what you see.

* If the `kmp` file is in the download folder, or already in a different folder. Please follow:

    ```c
    C:\Windows\system32>cd ../../

    C:\>cd ./Users/yourusername/Downloads

    C:\Users\mengh\Downloads>           // you are in the Downloads folder
    ```

* If the `kmp` file needs to be in a specific folder. Navigate to a different directory, then create a folder as such:

    ```c
    C:\Windows\system32>cd ../../

    C:\>mkdir keyman

    C:\>cd ./keyman

    C:\keyman>                          // you are in the keyman folder

    ```

* Move the `.kmp` file into correct folder, then run this command:

    ```c
    "C:\program files (x86)\keyman\keyman desktop\kmshell.exe" -i khmer_angkor.kmp=     // the final `=` sign is important
    ```

    (This will install khmer_angkor.kmp for all users, but with no language association.)

* The full command:

    ```c
    C:\keyman>"C:\program files (x86)\keyman\keyman desktop\kmshell.exe" -i khmer_angkor.kmp=
    ```

    ```c
    C:\Users\mengh\Downloads>"C:\program files (x86)\keyman\keyman desktop\kmshell.exe" -i khmer_angkor.kmp=
    ```

### Result

* The keyboard will be visible in Keyman Configuration, but not available for use by a user until they choose a language to use it with.

* The users can add the language they wish to use by selecting **Add/remove language** in the Keyman Configuration dialog for that keyboard.

* The default language(s) for that keyboard will be shown in the **Add Language to Keyboard** dialog, but they can choose an alternative if they prefer:

* This should enable you to type the keyboard with the correct language.
