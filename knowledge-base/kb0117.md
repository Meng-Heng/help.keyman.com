# HOWTO: Install a Keyman keyboard without a language on Keyman for Windows

This is a guide to help install a Keyman keyboard onto Keyman for Windows without any language association. It will be mostly useful if encountering the [transient LCIDs on Windows](/kb/116) issue.

## Installs with khmer_angkor.kmp

There are two methods to install, and both of them are practically the same until choosing where to place the `.kmp` file. To follow along, please prepare the `.kmp` file as follows:

* Get the `.kmp` file for [Khmer Angkor keyboard](https://keyman.com/keyboards/khmer_angkor) (or other keyboard of your choice) from [keyman.com](https://keyman.com/keyboards/).

* The file should be available at the *Package Download* of the keyboard details page

* Remember the location of the downloaded file, then Run the Command Prompt as Administrator.

* Continue to one of the method below.

### Method 1

In this method, we'll be working with the default directory of the Administrator: Command Prompt. For example: `C:\Windows\system32>`.

* Relocate the khmer_angkor.kmp file into the directory you see on the Command Prompt.

* Run the command (the final `=` sign is important):

    `"C:\program files (x86)\keyman\keyman desktop\kmshell.exe" -i khmer_angkor.kmp=` 

    (This will install khmer_angkor.kmp for all users, but with no language association.)

* Full Command:

```c
C:\Windows\system32>"C:\program files (x86)\keyman\keyman desktop\kmshell.exe" -i khmer_angkor.kmp=
```

### Method 2

Please follow this method if you see this error when running the command.

Without having to explain the technical information behind the error, let's focus on how to work around it.

* Use this command to go into a different directory, then create a folder as such:

```c
C:\Windows\system32>cd ../../

C:\>mkdir keyman

C:\>cd ./keyman

C:\keyman>

```

* Place the `.kmp` file into the keyman folder, then run the command (the final `=` sign is important).

    `"C:\program files (x86)\keyman\keyman desktop\kmshell.exe" -i khmer_angkor.kmp=`

    (This will install khmer_angkor.kmp for all users, but with no language association.)

* Full Command:

```c
C:\keyman>"C:\program files (x86)\keyman\keyman desktop\kmshell.exe" -i khmer_angkor.kmp=
```

### Result

* The keyboard will be visible in Keyman Configuration, but not available for use by a user until they choose a language to use it with.

* The users can add the language they wish to use by selecting **Add/remove language** in the Keyman Configuration dialog for that keyboard.

* The default language(s) for that keyboard will be shown in the **Add Language to Keyboard** dialog, but they can choose an alternative if they prefer:

* This should enable you to type the keyboard with the correct language.
