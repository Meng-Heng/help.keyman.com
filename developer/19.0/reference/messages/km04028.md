title: KM04028: ERROR_PackageMustNotContainItself

|            |           |
|------------|---------- |
| Message    | The package may not include a \.kmp file of the same name '&lt;param&gt;'\. |
| Module     | [kmc-package.PackageCompilerMessages](kmc-package.packagecompilermessages) |
| Identifier | `ERROR_PackageMustNotContainItself` |


While it is possible for a package file to contain other .kmp package files,
it is an error for a package file to contain a package with the same name as
itself.

**Note:** it is not recommended to include other package files within a
package, as the user experience for installation and uninstallation is
complex, and not consistent across all platforms.

**Note**: Nested packages are not checked for validity or whether or not they
may violate this rule transitively.
