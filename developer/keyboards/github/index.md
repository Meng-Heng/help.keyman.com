title: GitHub Keyboard Submission Guide
---

This guide is intended for keyboard developers who are submitting only one or two keyboards. 
It uses the online GitHub interface. 
If using "git" from the command line is not something familiar, this is the guide for you. 

Those familiar using "git" from the command line might want to consider the [Advanced Guide for Submitting Keyboards](../advanced). 
The Advanced guide provides separate instructions for deeper involvement in submitting, improving, and reviewing keyboards.

**Note:** This guide is written for Windows users, so other OS users need to adjust paths accordingly.

* [Preliminary Step: Is Your Keyboard Ready?](step-0)
* [Step 1: Setup - One Time Only](step-1)
* [Step 2: Organizing the Keyboard Files](step-2)
* [Step 3: Submitting a GitHub Pull Request](step-3)
