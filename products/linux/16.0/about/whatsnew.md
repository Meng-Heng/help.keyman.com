title: What's New

Here are some of the new features and major bug fixes we have added to Keyman for Linux 16.0:

* Improve setting context (#7084)
* Improved reordering and backspace behavior in Chrome(ium) and other apps that
  don't support surrounding text (#7079)
    * Note, this currently requires an update to ibus to be installed, pending
      upstream merge and distribution of ibus patches #2440 and 781119be. The
      packages.sil.org and https://launchpad.net/~keymanapp/+archive/ubuntu/keyman
      repos contain the updated ibus versions.
* Now supports Ubuntu 22.10 (Kinetic) (#6975)
* System tray will now show icon defined in keyboard instead of generic Keyman icon (#7678)
* Keyman 16 will be the last release that supports Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic.
* Fix uninstallation when using fcitx5 (#6963)
